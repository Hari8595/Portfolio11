      <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Project1</h2>

      <p>
        As a part of the team responsible for providing software for setup boxes, I contributed to the development of
        various features aimed at enhancing user experience. These features included seamless channel switching with the
        ability to simultaneously play one channel while recording another, as well as the implementation of live pause
        functionality. Additionally, I actively participated in the development and delivery of multiple releases for
        setup boxes. The project was executed successfully with a team size of 8 members.
      </p>

      <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Project2 </h2>

      <p>
        In this role, I had the key responsibilities of setting up and managing the pipeline, automating processes,
        utilizing Ansible for configuration management, overseeing build and release management, managing environments,
        and serving as the main point of contact for build and release-related matters. To streamline the development
        and deployment process, I implemented an automated build and deployment system using Jenkins CI tool,
        incorporating an automated code backup and restoration solution. This facilitated daily and weekly builds across
        various environments, including the critical PROD go-live releases. Furthermore, I ensured the continuous
        availability of the environments, including both PROD and PRE-PROD environments, guaranteeing seamless
        operations and minimizing downtime.
